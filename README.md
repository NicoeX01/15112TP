Welcome to Sokoban! Sokoban is a traditional Japanese game in which your goal 
is to push all the boxes to the red dots. You may only push, and not pull,
one box at a time. So moves are irreversible! 

There are four modes: 1) Classic play 2) Create your own game 3) Competing with an 
AI 4) Playing with music beats. 
In mode 4, you have to move on beat but you are allowed to miss beats. 
When creating your own board, you can choose to generate a random empty board to speed up the process. 
In addition, players get 3 hints for each level. 

To run the project, please make sure you have downloaded Aubio (library), the music files and all the images before running. The music files and images should be included when downloading the project (**TP). 
When all the above requirements are met, you can play the game by running main.py. 

If you are using Mac, please make sure that the .dos files are removed by using the remove.py. 

Controls in the game:
    to move: use arrow keys
    to restart: press Space 
    to choose a level: press the corresponding key
